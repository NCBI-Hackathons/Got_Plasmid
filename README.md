# Pangenomic Identification of Pathogenic Factors

## Goal
Defining the clinically relevant elements of the pangenome of Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogenic bacteria.   Challenge: mobile genetic elements are ambiguous as repeats, phages, plasmids, etc

 Identification of unique accessory elements in individual patient samples
Differentiation between screening (nose swabs) and lesions
Building a rapid pipeline to differentiate between phage, plasmid and low complexity regions in these differential sites.  
Extending that to other bacterial species

## Backgound and Significance
### Staphylococcus aureus genomes and mobile genetic elements (MGE).
 The proliferation of S. aureus genomic sequences in public databases reflects strong interest in understanding S. aureus genome diversity and evolution. With an average of 2,800 coding sequences, it is estimated that 44% of S. aureus genes are NOT shared by all S. aureus strains. These genes constitute the  ‘accessory genome’, which is variable between strains and mostly made of mobile genetic elements (MGE) enriched in hypothetical proteins. 

 Staphylococcal MGE encompass any intra- or extra-chromosomal DNA segment that can be independently mobilized within or between S. aureus cells. It includes plasmids, transposons, integrons, genomic islands, S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), integrative conjugative elements, staphylococcal chromosome cassettes, and phages. Together, phages and plasmids are the main source of MGE diversity among S. aureus strains. 

### Why study S. aureus MGE diversity?
 MGE discovery and characterization are important goals for clinical genomics analysis because almost all S. aureus strains harbor several MGE with potentially syndrome- and tissue-specific functions. 
 
### MGE diversity in NCBI 
 As of August 2017,  327 unique plasmid and 87 phage sequences have been identified and deposited in the US National Center for Biotechnology and Information (NCBI) database.  With the ease and speed of whiole genome sequencing, new MGE are discovered everyday, highlighting the impressive breadth of S. aureus MGE diversity.

### The challenge to study MGE diversity in NCBI 
 The extent and importance of MGE contribution to S. aureus pathogenesis is largely under-appreciated. This is mainly due to the complications inherent to their identification, analysis and characterization. 

	MGE  are highly repetitive. High level of sequence identity facilitates genetic recombination and contributes to the emergence of mosaic MGE. As such, MGE are ever-changing and can be hard to identify. Moreover, nomenclature in public databases is constantly evolving and inconsistency in annotation among MGE is common and complicates functional inter- and intra-species analyses.
