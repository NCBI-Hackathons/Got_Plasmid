# Pangenomic Identification of Pathogenic Factors

## Goal
Defining the clinically relevant elements of the pangenome of S aureus and other pathogenic bacteria.   Challenge: mobile genetic elements are ambiguous as repeats, phages, plasmids, etc

 Identification of unique accessory elements in individual patient samples
Differentiation between screening (nose swabs) and lesions
Building a rapid pipeline to differentiate between phage, plasmid and low complexity regions in these differential sites.  
Extending that to other bacterial species
